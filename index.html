                <p>
                    I am and always will be a student. I will keep the beginners mind by playing and experimenting without the fear of failure. There will always be things I have to learn and I will make mistakes, which develop me.

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an optimist and a realist. I always apply this mission statement in good faith and to achieve great results together with my team. In doing so, I am willing to learn and to teach. However, I acknowledge reality and respect mission statements of other people. Because I will not violate my mission statement, I will leave every situation where my core values are not shared

                <p>
                    I will be part of a team. In my software development team, I communicate clearly and proactively. I thrive for consistency and integrity of the creations of my team.
